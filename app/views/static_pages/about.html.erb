	<h3>What we believe</h3>
	<div class="well well-small"><p>We believe in the power of sharing. As a community, the users of Only Share save around <strong>three hundred tonnes</strong> of equipment from being landfilled each year. We understand and have witness the impact of giving gifts. Whether it's time to clean out the house, or upgrade the television, or dispose of the work furnite. We encourage people to use Only Share. Please support this website by recommending us at your workplace, to your friends and to the people in your community.

	<h3>How does it work</h3>
	<div class="well well-small"><p>Only share is a free online tool that allows people to post items they would like to share with someone else. 
	You can either give an item away, or search for an item you want.<br>
	<br>
	Everything posted on this website must be free, legal and appropriated for all ages. The standard format is <strong>giving</strong> and <strong>wanting</strong>. Once you have created an account with us, you will be able to see items posted in your area, as well as across the country. If you are searching for a specific item, you can search for it using our search facility. If you are unable to find what you are looking for, you can choose to be emailed if any items matching your search become available on our website. We will email you when items become available in your area by default, giving you the best opportunity to find what you are looking for.</p>
